Hello! My name is Victor and my hacker handler is tyto. Welcome to my Github profile. Here, you'll find a curated collection of security projects I've worked on throughout my journey.

## ðŸ§‘ About Me

I currently work as a Jr. Developer at DB Server. I'm a contractor in the IT Governance team at Sicredi, the first cooperative financial institution in Latin America. 

To get to know better my journey as software developer visit my main github:

- [Github: Victor Silva](https://github.com/victorhfsilva)

Offensive Security is a area that strongly fascinates me. That's why, I'm not just learning ethical hacking but also applying my knowledge in CTFs and Bug Bounties.
